# Supervised-ML-Polynomial-Regression

   
Polynomial regression with degree 1 is nothing but a Linear Regression.

Simple Linear regression models a straight line y=mx+b relationship between a dependent variable y and an independent variable x. 

Polynomial regression extends this by including higher powers of x for complex, non-linear relationships.

Deciding the degree will be based on trial and error, as well as domain knowledge

===============================
L1/Lasso Regularization

L2/Ridge regularization

Regularization helps in reducing overfitting

Higher polynomial will be reduced
